<h1>Aloo Gosht</h1>

    <p> Aloo Gosht is a flavorful curry made from tender chunks of mutton or beef simmered with potatoes in a spicy, aromatic gravy. The curry base is made from a blend of onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and a variety of spices, including turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The potatoes absorb the rich, spicy flavors, and the meat becomes tender and juicy. Aloo Gosht is a family favorite, often eaten with naan, paratha, or rice. It is a comforting dish that is perfect for family gatherings and festive occasions.</p>
